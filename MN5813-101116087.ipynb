    "Within the professional football context, injuries not only affect athletic performance but also creates a significant impact in economic terms: salaries paid during days off, limited availability of key players and even may lead to poor performance. Nevertheless, the idea of quantifying that impact is often challenging because the information is widely distributed across multiple sources (clubs and leagues data, injury records, salaries) and there is not always a clean join between datasets.\r\n",

    "Injuries in professional football have been investigated for years due to the fact that they are not “isolated” events, but a recurring phenomenon that repeats itself season after season. A reliable indicator of the magnitude of the presented topic is that long-term surveillance programs such as UEFA Elite Club Injury Study have acquired injury data for more than two decades, which reinforces the problem is frequent enough to demand systematic monitoring over time (Ekstrand et al., 2022)\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, the problem has become notably visible due to its annual scale. Howden’s Men’s European Football Injury Index reports that during season 2023/2024 (top five European leagues) there was a maximum of 4,123 injuries and an estimated cost of €732.02 million in wages paid to players while being inactive. That same report sustains that the frequency and costs have been increasing since 2020/2021 and that, since the index’s first edition, injuries have accumulated to 14,292 injuries (excluding COVID-19) with an approximate cost of €2.3 billion in wages (Howden Group Holdings, 2024).\n",
    "\r\n",
    "When considering the multi-season picture, the matter becomes particularly compelling. In the 2024/2025 index edition (five-season review), Howden indicates 22,596 injuries between years 2020 and 2025 within Europe’s five top leagues, with an estimated wage cost of €3.45 billion. This establishes injuries as not only an athletic issue but also a financial risk management one: clubs invest substantially in talent, but a portion of that investment is temporarily “lost” when a player is during a day off (Howden Group Holdings, 2024).\r\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of possible causes, the literature and public reports typically refrain from single explanations, but there is a context that repetitively appears: match load and calendar congestion. Through FIFPRO’s monitoring system (≈1,500 players), it was reported that 54% of the observed players faced “excessive or high” load demands in 2023/2024 and connects this pattern to risks to health and performance when recovery is deficient (FIFPRO, 2024).\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Against this backdrop, the present project matches with what can be transparently measured using public available data: quantifying how many injuries are recorded (counts by season, league and injury type), describing their severity using days of absence (when available in dataset) and approximating the direct economic impact as an estimate based on wages during periods of absence, in line with the “wage costs” approach used in recent sector reports.\n",

These transformations allow for analyzing not only the number of injuries that occur, but also their severity and potential financial impact.\n",
    "\n",

    "As a step of the procedure, standard libraries were imported from Python data analysis ecosystem in order to cover each step of the pipeline: text cleaning (re), numerical operations and missing value handling (numpy), table manipulation and integration (pandas) and visualization (matplotlib/seaborn). Additionally, specific utilities were used for enhancing the preprocessing and reproducibility quality: unicodedata to normalize text (remove accents and minimize errors in joins) and requote_uri to ensure that links to remote files (for instance, URLs with spaces or parenthesis) load consistently without inaccuracies. Before the analysis, global visualization and format parameters were defined (Pandas/Matplotlib/Seaborn) to secure consistency in the presentation of results. In Pandas, visualization options were extended (maximum columns/rows) and the numeric format was standardized to two decimal places with thousands separators, which facilitated data inspection during cleaning, validation and merges (for instance, salaries and costs review). In Matplotlib/Seaborn a default theme and sizes were set to figures, axes and labels, with the purpose of maintaining comparable and readable graphics throughout the notebook.\r\n"

    "To ensure comparability and consistency with available salary data, the analysis was restricted to the major European leagues (Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, Bundesliga, and Ligue 1). Furthermore, relevant seasons were filtered by identifying the starting year of each season. Since the Season field has heterogeneous formats (e.g., “2023–2024” and “22/23”), regular expression extraction and normalization to numeric format were applied, allowing for consistent filtering of records whose start year is 2022, 2023, or 2024. The result is df_lesiones_filtrada, which is used as the basis for descriptive analysis and subsequent integration with salaries."

    "This dashboard integrates the project's key visualizations into a single figure (small multiples) to simultaneously summarize the frequency, severity, and approximate economic impact of injuries. To ensure methodological consistency, reusable aggregations were first built from `df_plot`, including total cost per league, total cost per club (top 12), total cost per injury type (top 12), and temporal trends (number of records per season, and per season-league). This approach reduces code duplication and ensures that the graphs are based on the same cleaning and filtering rules previously applied to the final dataset."

    "First, the data sources were consolidated and cleaned to ensure consistency between injuries and salaries. The descriptive analysis was based on the filtered `df_lesiones_filtrada` and then on the physical `df_lesiones_fisicas`, where records associated with illness (e.g., virus/covid/infection) were excluded to maintain a focus on comparable physical injuries. Severity was operationalized using the variable `Days`, normalized to a numeric format (`days_num`), which allowed for quantifying days of absence without relying on heterogeneous text formats.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Subsequently, to estimate the direct economic impact, salaries and injuries were integrated using a composite key (`join_key`) constructed with league, club, season, and player. Prior to the merge, systematic name normalization (removal of accents, lowercase letters, punctuation cleaning, and space collapse) and club-specific mapping (`club_map`) were applied to resolve residual discrepancies between sources. The merge was performed as a LEFT JOIN from injuries to salaries, preserving all injury records and adding salary only when a match existed. Matching coverage was explicitly documented using the match rate (associated salaries / total injuries), allowing for methodologically transparent interpretation of the economic results.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Using the final economic base (df_lesiones_final), two metrics were derived for analysis: (i) estimated daily salary (salary_daily_eur = salary_eur / 365) and (ii) estimated cost per injury (injury_cost_eur = Days × salary_daily_eur). These transformations allowed for the simultaneous analysis of frequency (injury record count) and severity (days off work), as well as approximating the salary component of the economic loss.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "For visualization purposes, records were aggregated by season and league to construct a temporal trend of injuries (counts). To ensure accurate interpretation, a chronological order of seasons was imposed, preventing the visualization from being affected by alphabetical sorting. The trend figure by league allows for the comparison of patterns between competitions and the detection of changes in magnitude between seasons, highlighting that the number of injury records varies by league and by season, suggesting differences in competitive workload, player profiles, or contextual conditions (without attributing direct causality).\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Finally, using df_plot (a refined subset for visualization), the numerical columns were validated to ensure they were indeed numerical, and missing or invalid values ​​(residual zeros) were filtered out. This guarantees that the aggregations and sums (e.g., estimated total cost) reflect correct and comparable procedures."

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "This work demonstrates that, even with heterogeneous public data, it is possible to build a reproducible pipeline to describe injuries by league and season, quantify severity using days off, and approximate a direct economic impact based on salaries. The cleaning and standardization process was crucial: text normalization, harmonization of leagues and clubs, and the construction of a composite key allowed for the integration of sources that were not originally designed to \"talk to each other.\" A key lesson is that, in applied analytics, much of the value lies in making data comparable and traceable, rather than in applying \"complicated\" techniques without quality control.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the approach has significant limitations. First, the economic estimate relies on incomplete salary coverage: not all injury records are associated with a salary, so the cost results are derived from a subset and should not be interpreted as the total true cost of all injuries. Second, the estimated cost (Days × daily_salary) primarily captures the salary component during absence, excluding bonuses, substitutions, loss of athletic performance, effects on results, commercial revenue, or medical costs; therefore, it should be understood as a conservative approximation of the economic impact. Third, potential matching errors persist: even with normalization and mapping dictionaries, differences in names (e.g., transfers, abbreviations, or club changes) may reduce the match rate or introduce imperfect matches. Finally, the analysis presented is descriptive: it identifies patterns and differences between leagues/seasons but does not establish causality.\n",
    "\n",
    "As future improvements, the following are suggested: (i) expand and validate salary coverage using additional sources or transparent imputation strategies when salaries are missing; (ii) construct a more robust identifier per player (ideally a stable ID) to reduce name ambiguities; (iii) Incorporate additional exposure metrics (e.g., minutes played or schedule density) to normalize by workload and allow for fairer comparisons; and (iv) extend the economic analysis with scenarios that include indirect costs (e.g., cost per point lost or replacement cost), always documenting assumptions and sensitivity. Taken together, these improvements would strengthen both the accuracy of the estimate and the practical utility of the findings for clubs, analysts, and decision-makers."
